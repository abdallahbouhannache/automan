This framework allows you to automate your computational pipelines.

Features
--------

For a set of numerical simulations with a Python script one can:

- run all simulations and produce all figures with one command.
- distribute the simulations on a collection of idle computers.


Documentation
-------------

Complete documentation for this framework is in the form of a paper that is
currently under review, you can see a draft here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04786

The paper motivates and describes the software and how you can use it.

To see a complete example of a research publication using this framework, see
here: https://gitlab.com/prabhu/edac_sph

The ``README.rst`` in that repository documents how to set everything up. The
scripts to look at are in ``common.py`` and ``automate.py``.


The package name
----------------

The name automan comes from an old serial with the same name.  Most
other names were taken on pypi.
